## Using this collection

### Checking the Collection version

To check if the collection is installed on your system and its current version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection list community.kubevirt
```

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the kubevirt collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubevirt
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.kubevirt
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically if you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubevirt --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubevirt:==1.0.0
```
See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Installing the Collection with the Ansible package

Because the collection is shipped with Ansible, if you install the ``ansible`` package, the collection will be installed authomatically.

If you install the ``ansible-core`` package, you will need to intall the collection manually. Refer to the paragraph above.
